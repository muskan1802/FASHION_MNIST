# FASHION_MNIST
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. 

Dataset: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

This project has an accuracy of **99.73 %** using CNN and is well commented for proper understanding.

The dataset used in this project i.e., Fashion-mnist_train and test were too large to be uploaded here. This dataset can be found here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KsSOAP4q3B6WmNZA4GkmIyuWt5hbbLZ9?usp=sharing

To run this project both files in the above link should be placed in the same folder as the python script .

I have also uploaded some output screenshots in the repositiory under *Output Screenshots* folder.
